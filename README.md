My name is Ethan (he/him), and I'm a junior at the University of Utah studying computer science with an emphasis in game design.
I was formerly the software lead and team captain at [Spartan Robotics](https://github.com/Team997Coders), as well as the engineering officer for Gamecraft at the University of Utah. Currently, I am a four-time teaching assistant for a course on data structures & algorithms, and I have made several awesome games with my peers at [Monkey Barrel](https://github.com/MonkeyBarrelDevs)!
