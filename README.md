My name is Ethan (he/him), and I'm a freshman at the University of Utah studying computer science with an emphasis in game design.
I was formerly the software lead and team captain at [Spartan Robotics](https://github.com/Team997Coders), and am now exploring the world of game development with my peers on the [Monkey Barrel](https://github.com/MonkeyBarrelDevs) development team!
